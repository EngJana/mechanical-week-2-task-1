# Robot Legs Assembly and Control
This project involves the creation of robot legs using Blender for the 3D modeling using  servo SG90 motors that move the legs. Each leg consists of three segments: hip, knee, and foot.

# Creating the Robot Legs using Blender
1.	Generate the Robot Legs:
-	Using the provided code script to create a python code for the motors and a startup for robotâ€™s legs. The script creates two robot legs, each with three SG90 servos.
-	Run the script in Blender's scripting workspace. This will create the motors according to its measurements from the datasheet, and robot legs cubes that needs to be adjusted 
2.	Adjusting the Legs: Using Blender tools and modifiers to adjust the legs' measurements and prepare them for motor placement:
-	Move: Position the legs and motors.
-	Rotate: Adjust the motors to the desired orientation.
-	Scale: Modify the lengths of the leg segments along each axis.
-	Boolean Modifier: Cut sections of the legs to create space for the motors.
-	Bevel Modifier: Smooth the edges of the legs.
3.	Placement: Connect each servo motor to the corresponding segments of the robot leg (hip, knee, foot) and secure it using cylindrical shapes as nails.
